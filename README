***holgersson-overlay***

# Main
This is my private and unofficial [overlay][holgersson-overlay] for Gentoo/Linux.
There will be different ebuilds from different sources, hopefully only temporary, before submitting to the [main Gentoo bugtracker][bgo] resp. to the [main portage tree][portage].

# Setup & synchronisation
Just run layman from `app-portage/layman` with needed privileges, e.g. root:
```sh
$ layman -a holgersson-overlay
```
and optional for global updates:
```sh
$ layman -S
$ emerge --sync
```
You might set `USE="sync-plugin-portage"` for layman, too.

# Maintainer
If you encounter bugs, please send a mail to
```

```
or open a bug report on the [main Gentoo bugtracker][bgo]
(please remember to Cc me there). Bug descriptions, suggestions, patches,
critics and chorus of praise are all welcome!
