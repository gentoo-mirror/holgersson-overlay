# The tree version in ::gentoo is actually superior now.
# - fix my statfs prefixing to ${PN}-statfs which actually
#   does not made really sense.
# - use upstream's way to build and drastically shrink
#   the LoC in the ebuild.
# The only thing that itches me a bit is the larger binsize
# as the tree package does not strip anything, but I do not
# care enough.
